    Errors: >
        Errors that occured in the plotting process while reading from or writing data to disk.
        The chia plotter will retry in case of such an error after a short Seconds. One is not that bad.
        If you use external harddrives or network attached Storage this usally means the connection
        dropped. Reattach the device and chia will continue. If the error count keeps rising you need to troubleshoot.
    Progress: >
        Shows the progression defined by the number of steps done vs the number of steps left to completion.
        The number of steps tells you nothing about how long the process will take to completion.
    TimeRemaining: >
        An estimate on how long it will take for the plot to complete. It is based on the plots progress and all
        the data extracted from your finished plots. It will try to use the data of those plots that match the
        configuration of that plot most closely to make a better prediction if you mix hard disks, ssd, internal
        and external drives and even network attached storage.
    ETA: >
        An estimate on when the plotting process completes formatted MM/dd/yyyy H:mm. It is based on the plots
        progress and all the data extracted from your finished plots. It will try to use the data of those plots
        that match the configuration of that plot most closely to make a better prediction if you mix hard disks,
        ssd, internal and external drives and even network attached storage.
    CurrentTable: >
        The table number currently worked on. On phase 1 and 3 it will start with table 1 and work its way up to 7. In
        Phase 2 it will start with table 7 and work its way back to table 1. An arrow shows in which way it currently
        progresses.
    CurrentBucket: >
        The Chia plotter will work through each table in the phases 1 to 3 and will process each bucket in each table.
        This shows which bucket in the current table is currently worked on.
    CurrentPhase: >
        Shows in which of the four phases the plotting process is. It does not go back to a previous phase.
    Phase1Seconds: >
        The Seconds this plot process took to complete phase 1
    Phase2Seconds: >
        The Seconds this plot process took to complete phase 2
    Phase3Seconds: >
        The Seconds this plot process took to complete phase 3
    Phase4Seconds: >
        The Seconds this plot process took to complete phase 4
    TotalSeconds: >
        The Seconds this plot process took to complete
    PlotSize: >
        The k-size of the plot. Usally 32, which produces a 100GB plot file. Apparently there is very little
        reason to use a larger k-size for now.
    Threads: >
        The number of threads used to complete phase 1. As of now the other phases are not multithreaded
        and will only use one cpu core, tweaking this only affects phase 1
    Buffer: >
        This buffer size the plotter uses. It is used to sort the data within the buckets in memory.
        It will resort to a different sort algorithm which is slower on most tables. Too small buffer
        sizes will slow down the plotter, too large ones will bring no additional benefit, but lower
        the number on plotting processes you can run in parallel with the ram installed in your
        system.
    Buckets: >
        The number of parts a table will be split into. Each bucket is sorted individually. Each bucket
        gets written in its own file.
    StartDate: >
        When the plotting process was started.
    PlotName: >
        Name of the final plot file.
    LogFolder: >
        The folder in which this log file in stored. If you have multiple log folder for multiple rigs,
        this tells you which rig it is from.
    LogFile: >
        The name of the logfile.
    ApproximateWorkingSpace: >
        An estimate on how much temporary space was used during the creation of the plot.
    FinalFileSize: >
        The size of the finished plot file. Varies little over the same k-size.
